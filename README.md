## Introduction
This [Slack](https://slack.com) [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) is inspired by car2go's previous platform `luncher2go` which matches coworkers of one location on demand to get to know new colleagues while having lunch.

The app is optimized for [zeit now](https://zeit.co/now), so that it is possible to deploy the app with a single command: 

```sh
now car2go/erna
```

The basic idea behind erna is to enter a specific command, choose your current location and get your match at 11:30am Europe/Berlin. In case of an odd number of applicants, there's one group of three people. Otherwise it is a 1on1. You get even notified in the unfortunate case of no match. But don't be sad â€“Â keep trying and tell your coworkers about the app ðŸ˜‰.

It is still work in progress and uses internal storage.  
Feel free to contribute new storage providers or other features.

## Configuration
> The configuration is based on environment variables.

- `LOCATIONS`

The list of locations is required.  
Pass in a comma-separated list of available locations.  
Those locations are provided as interactive command, so people can choose there current location on a daily basis.

Example:
```sh
LOCATIONS=Berlin,Stuttgart,Hamburg,Ulm
```

If just one location is provided, erna skips the prompt for choosing the location as it is unnecessary. 

- `TOKEN`

The Slack OAuth token is required.  
How to get the token and set the required permissions is explained in section [setup](#setup).

Example:
```sh
TOKEN=xoxp-12345678-87654321-10011001-3x4mp13
```

- `PORT`

Pass in an integer to use a custom port.  
The default port is `3000`.

Example:
```sh
PORT=8080
```

## Setup
### Slack App
Create a Slack app ([here](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps)).  
Assign a name and a workspace in the following steps.

![create slack app](./assets/create-slack-app.png)

After setting up the Slack app you have to add features like the slash command, interactive components and permissions.

![add features and functionality](./assets/features.png)

Start with the slash command, enter the root url of the future service and other options like the command name and a hint.

![create slash command](./assets/command.png)

Continue with the interactive components which enables to ask for the current location.  
Extend the root url with the `/folks` path.

![create interactive component](./assets/interactive.png)

Finally grant the required permissions

- `chat:write:bot`
- `commands`

and install the app to workspace.
Note the provided OAuth token to deploy erna.

### Deploy *erna*
To deploy erna as microservice, use zeit now

```sh
now -e LOCATIONS=SF,NYC car2go/erna
```

or any other preferred way.  


## Development
To simplify the local development and testing, read the [slack tutorial](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok) about using tunneling.

Basically it's enough to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), run `npm start` in the repository and tunnel the port `ngrok http 3000`. Use the output temporary URL in the Slack app settings.
