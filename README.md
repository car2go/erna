## Introduction
This [Slack](https://slack.com) [slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) is inspired by car2go's previous platform `luncher2go` which matches coworkers of one location on demand to get to know new colleagues while having lunch, a coffee chat or similar.

The basic idea behind **erna** is to enter a specific command, choose your current location and get your match at the defined time, day and week. In case of an odd number of applicants, there's one larger group. You get even notified in the unfortunate case of no match. But don't be sad â€“Â keep trying and tell your coworkers about the app ðŸ˜‰.

While starting, **erna** generates to 250 scheduled events per timezone which are enough for roughly 1-24 years. Additionally it is possible to schedule custom location-specific events via a subcommand `schedule`.

The app is optimized for [zeit now v1](https://zeit.co/now), so that it is possible to deploy the app with a few commands: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/car2go/erna.git
cd erna
now
```

Feel free to contribute new storage providers or other features.  
Since **erna** is a cronjob-like service ensure that the app is scaled exactly once at a single datacenter.

## Flows
### Sign up for date
1. Run the command
    1. Get notified when the bot matches people.
    1. If there is just one location, sign up automatically
1. Choose
    1. Cancel signup process
    1. Select Location and sign up
1. Get notified with exact date/time of your match
1. Get notified as soon as you matched
    1. Conversation with bot and match partners is created

### Update existing date
1. Run the command again
    1. Get notified that you aleady have signed up
    1. Provide options based on count of locations
1. Choose
    1. Cancel date
    1. Update date
        1. just available if there are multiple locations
        1. restart the signup process
        1. it is not possible to cancel the update process

### Schedule a custom event
1. Run the command with a `schedule` subcommand:  
`/<command> schedule <location> <yyyy-mm-dd> <hh:mm (UTC)>`
    1. Get notified that something went wrong in case of failure.
    1. Get notified about the scheduled event in case of success.

## Configuration
The configuration is based on environment variables.

### `LOCATIONS`

Pass in a list of available locations including the related timezone.  
Those locations are provided as interactive command, so people can choose their current location on a daily basis.  

As already said, it is necessary to define the related [timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) ([map](http://efele.net/maps/tz/)).  
Each timezone is enclosed between `#` and `:`:

```sh
[#<Timezone>:<Location>[,<Location>*]]+
```

Example:
```sh
LOCATIONS=#Europe/Berlin:Berlin,Hamburg#America/New_York:NYC
```

If just one location is provided, **erna** skips the prompt for choosing the location as it is unnecessary. 

### `TOKEN`

The Slack Bot User OAuth Access Token is required.  
How to get the token and set the required permissions is explained in the [slack setup chapter](docs/slack-setup.md).

Example:
```sh
TOKEN=xoxp-12345678-87654321-10011001-3x4mp13
```

### `SECRET`

The Slack app its signing secret is required.  
Slack provides the app its signing secret on the **Base Information** page of your app.

Example:
```sh
SECRET=12345abcdef67890
```

### `[DB=undefined]`

Pass in a custom database url containing all information like credentials, clusters, replica set and further options. 
Default is no external database, so it uses an in-memory state instead.  
Further information about the storage is listed in the [storage adapter chapters](docs/storage-adapter.md).

Example:
```sh
DB=mongodb://username:password@one.myinstance.com:27017,two.myinstance.com:27017?ssl=true&replicaSet=myCluster
```

### `[PORT=3000]`

Pass in an integer to use a custom port.  
This variable is optional and its default is `3000`.

Example:
```sh
PORT=8080
```

### `[MATCH_SIZE=2]`

Pass in an integer as desired match size.  
Actual size may differ because of an odd number of members per location.  
So the possible group size is `2 â‰¤ [ACTUAL_MATCH_SIZE] â‰¤ [MATCH_SIZE] + 1 `

Example:
```sh
MATCH_SIZE=4
```

### `[MATCH_TIME=11:30]`

Pass in a simple 24hr format to define the local time of announcing the matches.  
Do not pass `am`/`pm` 12hr formats. This option affects both the Slack messages and the scheduled matches.

Example:
```sh
MATCH_TIME=15:00
```

### `[MATCH_DAY=MON]`

Pass in a single day matching the `/^(MON|TUE|WED|THU|FRI|SAT|SUN)$/` pattern to define the day or range of days for announcing the matches.  
This option affects both the Slack messages and the scheduled matches.

Example:
```sh
MATCH_DAY=TUE
```

### `[MATCH_INTERVAL=1,2,3,4,5]`
Pass in a comma-separated list of week numbers per month matching the pattern `/^[1-5](,[1-5])?$/`.  
It filters the generated events by week numbers. So passing `1,3` excludes all events scheduled in the second, fourth and fifth week of a month.

Example:
```sh
MATCH_DAY=1,3
```

## Deployment 
To simplify the deployment of **erna** there are a couple of ways to pass the configurations mentioned above.  
Since this service is optimized for [zeit now v1](https://zeit.co/now) the following lines focus on this service. But it is quite easy and straightforward to adapt the principle to other services.

### Now CLI
The easiest way to deploy **erna** is to define a custom `.env` like `.env.erna.prod` and pass the file directly to the CLI.

```sh
# .env.erna.prod

LOCATIONS=#Europe/Berlin:Berlin,Hamburg#America/New_York:NYC
TOKEN=xoxp-12345678-87654321-10011001-3x4mp13
SECRET=12345abcdef67890
DB=mongodb://username:password@one.myinstance.com:27017,two.myinstance.com:27017?ssl=true&replicaSet=myCluster
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/car2go/erna.git
cd erna
now -E .env.erna.prod
```

### Other Services
Alternatively it is possible to clone the repository, enter the created directory, create a `.env` file and deploy the service. There is an integrated solution which fetches an existing `.env` file, so no further actions are needed.

```sh
# .env

LOCATIONS=#Europe/Berlin:Berlin,Hamburg#America/New_York:NYC
TOKEN=xoxp-12345678-87654321-10011001-3x4mp13
SECRET=12345abcdef67890
DB=mongodb://username:password@one.myinstance.com:27017,two.myinstance.com:27017?ssl=true&replicaSet=myCluster
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/car2go/erna.git
cd erna
# deploy via `now` or similar
```

## Development
To simplify the local development and testing, read the [slack tutorial](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok) about using tunneling.

Basically it's enough to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), run `npm start` in the repository and tunnel the port `ngrok http 3000`. Use the output temporary URL in the Slack app settings.

### Environment Validation & Configuration
The validator (`./lib/env/validator.js`) is reponsible for handling and validating environment variables. The schema listed in `./lib/env/schema.js` defines which variables are required, what are their defaults, which regex pattern is required and how to transform the passed values.

For this purpose the schema is an object of objects with the following properties:

- `name <string>`  
  Define the name of the instance variable which exposes the transformed value.  
  E.g. `name="port"` enables access via `env.port`.

- `[required=false] <boolean>`  
  Define if a environment variable is required.  
  Throws an error in case of `undefined`.  

- `[desc=''] <string>`  
  Short escription of the related variable.
  Should be provided for a object even though its not required. It enriches the error messages which further details.

- `[default=undefined] <*>`  
  The default value of the variable.  
  Is only mindful in the case of optional ones.

- `[pattern=undefined] <RegExp>`  
  The pattern which validates the value of a defined variable. Has no effect in case of `undefined`.  
  Throws an error in case of failure.

- `[transform=undefined] <Function>`  
  A function which transforms the value (or default).  
  The function receives the value a first argument and is required to return a new value.

  Example:
  ```js
  {
    name: 'port',
    default: '3000',
    transform(x) {
      return parseInt(x, 10)
    }
  }
  ```

  This definition allows access to the port parsed as integer via `env.port`.

- `[props=undefined] <Object.<Function>>`  
  An object of function which behave like `transform` but enable various representations of a single variable.  
  It is not possible to define both `props` and `transform`.

  Example:
  ```js
  {
    name: 'users',
    props: {
      list(x) {
        return x.split(' ')
      },
      raw(x) {
        return x
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  This definition allows access to a split string via `env.users.list` and the original string via `env.users.raw`.
